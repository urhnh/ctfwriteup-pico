# Challenge

What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?

Hint: Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was '22', you would submit 'picoCTF{22}' as the flag.

# Solution

![ascii table](https://github.com/urhnh/ctfwriteup-pico/assets/149639198/8796ab05-292c-45de-8f77-c6ae14140fb4)

- base 16 is hex. 3D hex in decimal is 61 so the flag is picoCTF{61}
