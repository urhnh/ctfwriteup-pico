# Challenge

Can you find the flag in file without running it?

Hint: strings

# Solution

- easiest way is download the file, open in notepad and search for picoCTF word. there you go!

- not sure the right way to use strings function, but what I see from walkthroughs on youtube;

- ```wget https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/fae9ac5267cd6e44124e559b901df177/strings```

- ```strings strings | grep picoCTF```
