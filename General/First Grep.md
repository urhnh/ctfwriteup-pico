# Challenge

Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

Hint: grep tutorial

# Solution

- we can open the file using notepad and search the picoCTF keyword actually but the correct way using grep is

- ```wget https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/515f19f3612bfd97cd3f0c0ba32bd864/file```
  
- ```egrep 'picoCTF' file```
