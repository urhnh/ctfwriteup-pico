# Challenge

If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

Hint: Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

# Solution

![ascii table](https://github.com/urhnh/ctfwriteup-pico/assets/149639198/56f46783-9b65-4beb-8c05-a2c7840e75ee)

- refer to above table, hex 70 in ascii is p. hence the flag is picoCTF{p}
